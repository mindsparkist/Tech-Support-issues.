Give me some opening and closing lines as  one of my college adds in into a 3 way call with the customer

**Opening Lines:**

* "Good morning/afternoon/evening, [Customer's Name]. I'm [Your Name], and I've brought in [Colleague's Name] to assist with [issue]. They have expertise in [relevant area]."
* "Hi [Customer's Name], I'm [Your Name], and I've invited [Colleague's Name] to join our call. They'll be able to provide additional insights and assistance with [issue]."

**Closing Lines:**

* "Thank you for your time and patience. We'll follow up with you on [next steps or agreed-upon actions]."
* "Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions or require additional assistance."
* "We appreciate your understanding and cooperation."
