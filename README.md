### Active Connections
* **Network adapters:** These are the physical devices (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.) that connect your computer to a network.
* **Connection status:** Indicates whether each adapter is connected or disconnected.
* **Connection details:** Provides information like IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers.

### Network and Sharing Center
* **Network status:** Displays the current network status (connected, disconnected, limited connectivity).
* **Active networks:** Shows the networks you're currently connected to.
* **Network properties:** Allows you to configure network settings, such as sharing options, public or private network profiles, and firewall settings.
* **Troubleshooting tools:** Provides access to built-in network diagnostics and troubleshooting tools.

### Additional Information (Depending on OS)
* **Virtual network adapters:** If you're using virtualization software (like VirtualBox or VMware), you might see virtual network adapters listed here.
* **VPN connections:** If you have active VPN connections, they will be displayed in the Network Connections screen.

## Driver vs. Adapter: A Clear Distinction

**Driver:**

* **Software component:** A driver is a software program that acts as an interface between the operating system and a hardware device.
* **Functionality:** It translates commands from the operating system into instructions that the hardware can understand, and vice versa.
* **Example:** A graphics card driver interprets commands from the operating system and controls the graphics card to display images on the screen.

**Adapter:**

* **Hardware component:** An adapter is a physical device that allows different types of hardware to communicate or connect with each other.
* **Functionality:** It converts signals or power from one format to another.
* **Example:** A power adapter converts AC power from a wall outlet into DC power for a laptop.

**To summarize:** A driver is the software that enables communication between a hardware device and the operating system, while an adapter is the physical hardware that facilitates connection between different devices or systems.
