## Understanding Ethernet Port LED Lights

Ethernet port LED lights are small visual indicators that provide information about the status and activity of your network connection. Typically, there are two LED lights on an Ethernet port:

### 1. Link/Connection LED
* **Indicates:** Whether a network cable is properly connected and a link has been established.
* **Behavior:**
  * **Solid on:** A link is established, and the port is connected to a network device.
  * **Off:** No cable is connected or there's no link established.

### 2. Activity LED
* **Indicates:** Network traffic or data transfer.
* **Behavior:**
  * **Blinking:** Data is being transmitted or received.
  * **Off:** No data is being transferred.

### Color Codes
* **Green:** Often indicates a faster connection speed (e.g., 100 Mbps or 1000 Mbps).
* **Amber or Yellow:** Usually indicates a slower connection speed (e.g., 10 Mbps).

**Note:** The specific behavior and color meanings of LED lights can vary slightly depending on the device or manufacturer.

### Example:

[Image of Ethernet port LED lights]

In the image above:
* **Left LED (solid green):** Indicates a link is established at a 1000 Mbps speed.
* **Right LED (blinking green):** Indicates network activity (data transfer).

### Troubleshooting with LED Lights
By observing the LED lights, you can quickly diagnose basic network issues:
* **No link (both LEDs off):** Check the cable connection, ensure the device is powered on, and verify network settings.
* **Link established but no activity (link LED on, activity LED off):** There might be no network traffic or a software issue.
* **Constant blinking activity LED:** High network traffic or potential network congestion.

**Remember:** While LED lights provide valuable information, they are not a definitive diagnostic tool. For more complex network issues, you might need to use network diagnostic tools or consult with a network administrator.

**A rolling log is a type of log file that is designed to automatically manage its size.** Instead of growing indefinitely, a rolling log will either:

1. **Overwrite:** The oldest entries are overwritten by newer ones once the log reaches a predetermined size.
2. **Archive:** The log is archived (copied to another location) when it reaches a certain size, and a new, empty log file is created.

This mechanism helps prevent log files from consuming excessive disk space, which can be a significant issue in production environments.

**Common rolling log strategies include:**

* **Time-based rolling:** Logs are rotated based on time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
* **Size-based rolling:** Logs are rotated when they reach a specific size.
* **Number-based rolling:** A fixed number of log files are kept, with the oldest ones being deleted when new ones are created.

**Rolling logs are often used in:**

* **Web servers:** To track access logs, error logs, and other server activity.
* **Application servers:** To log application events, errors, and performance metrics.
* **System logs:** To record system events, security incidents, and other system-related information.

By using rolling logs, organizations can efficiently manage their log data, ensuring that important information is retained while preventing excessive storage consumption.
